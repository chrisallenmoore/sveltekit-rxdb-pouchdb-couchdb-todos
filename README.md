## TODO
- [ ] Change how todo items are updated and marked completed. rxDB doesn't allow svelte binding on rxDB's data directly, get the following error

## Give it a whirl

Once you've cloned or downloaded the project, install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment.
